                    <div id="paragraph">
                        <p>"Earth is Decouring Her Children" is a graphic I made for my Digital Design Principles Class. It is a play on Francisco Goya's painting, "Saturn Devouring His Son" and is meant to depict the environmental concerns of our time. The central focus is on the Earth, personified as a powerful and maternal figure, her expression a blend of sorrow and determination. Like the grotesque and monstrous portrayal of Saturn in the original painting, the Earth is portrayed as both the creator and destroyer, symbolizing the intricate relationship between humanity and the planet. </p>
                        </br>
                        <p>I wanted this graphic to spark a conversation about the interconnectedness of humanity and the planet, prompting reflection on the responsibility each individual bears in preserving the delicate balance of nature, while also paying tribute to an artist and painting I have loved for a long time. Saturns dishevlled condition, agressive movements, and overall state of hysterical madness was always captivating to me and I wanted to channel the feelings of urgency I got from that painting into something relevant today.</p>
